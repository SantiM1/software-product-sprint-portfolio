      <p class= "text1">Hello everyone! You've seen my name by now, but allow me to introduce myself.
        I'm a 19 years old Computer Science student down at Tecnologico de Monterrey, 
        city where I currently live in, even though I'm originally from Ecuador. I love to draw, specially
        with ink, pencils and pens, mostly doing black and white pieces, let me show you an example:  </p>
        <div id="gallery">
        <img class = "img" src="images/art1.png" /> 
        <img class = "img" src="images/art2.png" /> 
        <img class = "img" src="images/art3.png" /> 
        </div>
      <p class="text1"> Anyways, heres <a href="https://github.com/SantiM1">my GitHub</a>. 
        Right now there's not much, but I'm hoping it'll grow exponentially soon, it's quite a shame my most 
        impressive project(in my opinion) is currently private due to a privacy agreements but let me show you some the things 
        I'm allowed to, like a small demo of the working product which was a heatmap implemented in Unity.</p>

        </div>
      <p class ="text1">Most recently I've been working on an app mockup for an online library concept, however it is in Spanish.
         You can interact with the demo by clicking on it how you would with a normal phone and pressing R to restart it. </p>
