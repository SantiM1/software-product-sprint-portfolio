      <p id= "intro">Hello everyone! You've seen my name by now but allow me to introduce myself.
        I'm a 19 years old Computer Science student down at Tecnologico de Monterrey, 
        city where I currently live even though I'm originally from Ecuador. I love to draw
        with ink and pens, mostly doing black and white pieces with usually either really cute 
        or creepy themes, let me show you an example:  </p>
        <img class = "img" src:"/images/art1.png"/> 
      <p>Click <a href="/hello">here</a> to see content created by server code.</p>
      <p>Click here to get a random message:</p>
      <button onclick="addRandomGreeting()">Hello</button>
      <div id="greeting-container"></div>
    </div>
